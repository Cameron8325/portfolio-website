        <h2>From Concept to Code: Creating the myFlix Backend</h2>

        <div class="chapter"><img src="img/heroImage.jpg" /></div>

        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p>
          Among my earliest endeavors as a budding student of web development
          stands the myFlix Backend. It was my very first API and database
          configuration—a journey of discovery where challenges were met with
          determination, and triumphs were celebrated with pride.
        </p>

        <h3>Purpose & Context:</h3>
        <p>
          The objective was clear: to build a robust API that could handle a
          vast collection of movies and provide users with seamless access to
          movie details. This was my first real taste of full-stack web
          development, and as such, I made sure to study the structure and flow
          of the language. When I’ve taught myself a new language in the past,
          whether programming or foreign, I focused on understanding how the
          puzzle pieces fit together instead of learning one block at a time.
          That experience would soon prove extremely beneficial.

        </a>

        <h3>Preparation:</h3>
        <p>
          I started the journey simply: I wrote out which libraries, middleware,
          and database I wanted to use. I settled on Express, MongoDB,
          Passport.js, and Morgan. I took some time to read the documentation
          before I felt confident enough to set up my (first-ever) API index.js
          file. While importing the proper packages, I knew I would need some
          sample data to test my endpoints with. After all, what good is serving
          a request if there is nothing to serve? Whipping up an array of movie
          objects flew by, and before I knew it, I was ready to start stitching
          together my first endpoint!
        </p>
        <img src="img/explore.jpg" />

        <h3>Execution & Challenges:</h3>
        <p>
          Once the first endpoint was created, the rest was practice. I would
          take time to reflect on the functionality I wanted for my app,
          ensuring that I covered every base. I took a look at the console to
          see if there were any errors, and to my surprise, there were none! I
          opened Postman to begin testing the endpoints with different headers
          and credentials. I was soon met with hurdles that felt like mountains
          at the time. One of the significant challenges was ensuring that the
          API endpoints had the proper syntax and followed the model properly.
          After consulting the vast wealth of knowledge known as Google and AI,
          I decided I needed a second pair of eyes, so I messaged my tutor.
          Maybe I was too close to the project, maybe I had forgotten a
          dependency, maybe his seasoned eyes could see something I was
          overlooking. Sure enough, the problem was discovered, small but
          humbling nonetheless. A letter had been capitalized where it shouldn’t
          have been. After a laugh and a correction, everything was ready for
          production! …Right?

        </a>

        <h3>Finalization:</h3>
        <p>
          Ok, so I may have been jumping the gun. One hurdle still remained in
          my learning. The last, but certainly not least, important part of web
          development: Security. The “Who are you” and “What are you allowed to
          do” of an application, or in layman’s terms, Authentication and
          Authorization. Not only did I need to add this critical aspect, but I
          also needed to persist the login so users wouldn’t be prompted to
          enter their credentials for every new page. Luckily, there were tools
          available for such a task. These tools were staple names: bcrypt,
          passport, and express-validator. By implementing these proven building
          blocks, my site was finally adhering to CORS policies, safe from
          threat, and at last ready for production!

        <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
        <p>
          This project was a critical step for me as a student. Throughout the
          ups and downs I faced, whether it be a miscased letter or new syntax
          to learn, I remained hopeful. The experience is something I will
          always reflect on: the journey, the learning, and the help I received.
          These aspects have become the foundation on which I will approach and
          grow with all future projects. I’m ever curious about where my (or
          your) next project will take me. I look forward to meeting it with an
          open mind and innovative solutions.
